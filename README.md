# 2015 Lopez Jr
The Python code for Lopez Jr, team 4009's Recycle Rush bot, now totes official.
The name Lopez Jr. has originated from the eleventh season of the popular
webseries Red v. Blue, since it's a robot & we already have a Lopez - Media
captain Matt. It's a nice robot, and I'm glad we can run Python on it.
